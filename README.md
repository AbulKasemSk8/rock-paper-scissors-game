# rock-paper-scissors-game
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The player competes against the computer by choosing one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The program randomly selects the computer's choice and determines the winner based on the traditional rules of the game.
